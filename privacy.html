        <h2 class="item">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="item"> We know privacy is important to you. We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy to understand the
            information we
            collect, how we use it, and the choices available to you. </p>

        <p class="item"> This Privacy Policy applies to the information we collect about you in the course of our business, including
            through
            Phono websites and online forums, products, mobile applications, services, marketing activities, research,
            retail
            locations, and other online or offline offerings operated by or on behalf of Phono. We refer to these
            products,
            services, and offerings collectively as the “Services.”</p>

        <h2 class="item">The information we collect</h2>
        <p class="item">The information we collect about you depends on the Services you use, how you use them, and the information

            We collect information in three main ways: (1) information you choose to provide to us; (2) information we
            collect automatically through technology when you use the Services; and (3) information we collect from
            other sources.</p>
        <h3 class="item">Information you choose to provide to us</h3>
        <p class="item">When you use our Services, you may choose to provide certain information to us. For example, we collect
            information directly from you when you place an order and purchase from us, create or use a Phono account,
            register your product, post comments, photos, or videos to the Services, participate in Phono surveys or
            research, or communicate and interact with us.
