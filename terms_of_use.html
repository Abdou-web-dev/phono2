        <h1>Phono Website and Product Terms of Use</h1>

        <h2>1. INFORMATION ABOUT US</h2>

        <p> The Services that link to these Terms are controlled and operated by Phono from its offices located at 100
            Mountain
            Road, Framingham, Massachusetts, 01701, in the United States of America. To contact us, please see our
            contact

        <a class="homebtn" href="./index.html"> <img src="./img/home (2).png" alt=""></a>


        <h2> 2. ELIGIBILITY AND SCOPE</h2>
        <p>2.1 Eligibility. To use the Services you must be, and represent and warrant that you are, of legal age (18
            years
            of
            age or older or otherwise of legal age in your jurisdiction, or, if you have parental consent, 13 years of
            age)
            and
            able to agree to these Terms. If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you
            represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s
            behalf
            and
            bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to "you" and "your" in these Terms, except for in
            this
            sentence, refer to that organization or entity). If Phono has previously prohibited you from accessing or
            using
            the
            Services, you are not permitted to access or use the Services.

            2.2 API Access and License Agreement. “Phono API” means any Phono application programming interface/API and
            related:
            (i) software, (ii) specifications, (iii) documentation, and (iv) intellectual property, provided by Phono to
            enable
            interoperability between any Phono product and a software application. “Developer Application” means any
            software
            application developed by you or on your behalf to interface with and interoperate with a Phono product
            through a
            Phono
            API. In order to access and use a Phono API, you must enter into a separate written or electronic licensing
            agreement
            with Phono, which may be in the form of an end-user license agreement/EULA, (each a “Developer License
            Agreement”).
            If you choose to interact with the Phono API, the applicable Developer License Agreement and not these Terms
            governs
            your license to the applicable Phono API. Always check the applicable Developer License Agreement to make
            certain
            that neither you nor your software application(s) infringe the rights of Phono or others.</p>

        <h2>3. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND USE</h2>

        <p> 3.1 Account Registration and Confidentiality. You may be required to create an account to use parts of the
            Services.
            If so, during the registration process, you must select a user name and password and provide us with
            additional
            information. It is your responsibility to ensure that your password remains confidential and secure. By
            registering,
            you agree that you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your user name and password. We
            may
            assume that any communications we receive under your account have been made by you.

            3.2 Unauthorized Account Use. You are responsible for notifying us if you become aware of any unauthorized
            use
            of or
            access to your account. To contact us, please see our Contact us page. You understand and agree that we may
            require
            you to provide information that may be used to confirm your identity and help ensure the security of your
            account.
            Phono will not be liable for any loss, damages, liability, expenses or lawyers’ fees that you may incur as a
            result
            of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge and/or authorization,
            and
            regardless of whether you have or have not advised us of such unauthorized use. You will be liable for
            losses,
            damages, liability, expenses and lawyers’ fees incurred by Phono or a third party due to someone else using
            your
            account.</p>

            developed, compiled, prepared, revised, selected, and arranged by Phono and others through the application
            of
            methods
            and standards of judgment developed and applied through the expenditure of substantial time, effort, and
            money
            and
            constitute valuable intellectual property of Phono and such others.

            You agree to protect the proprietary rights of Phono and all others having rights in the Services during and
            after
            the term of these Terms and to comply with all reasonable written requests made by Phono or its suppliers
            and
            licensors (collectively, “Suppliers”) of content or otherwise to protect their and others’ contractual,
            statutory,
            and common law rights in the Services. You agree to notify Phono immediately upon becoming aware of any
            claim
            that
            the Services infringe upon any copyright, trademark, or other contractual, statutory, or common law rights.

            All present and future rights in and to trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks,
            know-how,
            and
            other proprietary rights of any type under the laws of any governmental authority, domestic or foreign,
            including
            without limitation rights in and to all applications and registrations relating to the Services shall, as
            between
            you and Phono, at all times be and remain the sole and exclusive property of Phono. Any unauthorized use of
            any
            material contained on or through the Services may violate copyright laws, trademark laws, the laws of
            privacy
            and
            publicity and communications regulations and statutes.</p>

        <h2>5. USER CONTENT AND SUBMISSIONS</h2>

        <p> 5.1 User Content and Posts. The Services may enable you to submit, post, upload, or otherwise make available
            (collectively, "Post") content such as video clips, photographs, reviews, questions, comments, public
            messages,
            ideas, designs, features, business plans, inventions, product feedback, comments and other content
            (collectively,
            "User Content") that may or may not be viewable by other users.

            5.2 Our License to User Content. When you Post User Content on or through the Services, other than a
            Developer
            Application as applicable, you grant Phono a world-wide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free,
            non-exclusive,
            and
            sub-licenseable license to use, copy, distribute, reproduce, modify, edit, adapt, publicly perform, publicly
            display, translate, create derivative works from, sell, lease, transmit, communicate to the public,
            disassemble,
            and
            publish such User Content, in whole or in part, in any format or medium now known or developed in the
            future,
            including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Services (and derivative
            works
            thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our use of your
            personal data shall be governed by the Phono Privacy Policy.

            5.3 User Content Representations. You acknowledge and agree that all User Content that you Post is your sole
            responsibility. You represent that you have all required rights to Post or transmit such User Content
            without
            violation of any third-party rights. You understand that Phono does not control, and is not responsible for,
            User
            Content, and that by using the Services, you may be exposed to User Content from other users that is
            offensive,
            indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise objectionable. Please also note that User Content may contain
            typographical errors, other inadvertent errors or inaccuracies. You agree that you will indemnify, defend,
            and
            hold
            harmless Phono for all claims resulting from User Content you Post. We reserve the right, at our own
            expense, to
            assume the exclusive defense and control of such disputes, and in any event you will cooperate with us in
            asserting
            any available defenses.

            5.4 User Content Review. You acknowledge and agree that Phono and its designees may or may not, at Phono's
            discretion,
            pre-screen User Content before its appearance on the Services (but does not assume any obligation to). You
            further
            acknowledge and agree that Phono reserves the right (but does not assume the obligation) in its sole
            discretion
            to
            reject, move, edit or remove any User Content that is contributed to the Services. Additionally, Phono has
            the
            right
            to remove any User Content that violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable in Phono's sole
            discretion.
            You
            acknowledge and agree thatPhono does not verify, adopt, ratify, or sanction User Content, and you agree that
            you
            must
            evaluate and bear all risks associated with your use of User Content or your reliance on the accuracy,
            completeness,
            or usefulness of User Content.

            5.5 User Submissions. Phono maintains an exceptionally strong commitment to research. Researching new
            technologies,
            incorporating the new technologies into products, and developing marketing strategies for our products may
            take
            several years. For example, our Acoustic Noise Cancelling, PhaseGuide, and QuietPort technologies were in
            research
            and product development for many years before being integrated in commercial products and introduced to the
            public.
            We wish to avoid any misunderstandings that could arise if a Phono product or marketing strategy bears even
            a
            superficial resemblance to an idea that was submitted to Phono during the development process, or if a
            product
            feature or function may seem related to customer observations submitted to us. Phono does not provide any
            compensation, in either cash or product, for User Content submitted to Phono, including without limitation
            any
            idea
            for a potential software application. If you still submit such information to us you agree that such
            information
            shall be deemed to be non-confidential and nonproprietary, and Phono shall have no obligation of any kind
            with
            respect to such information and shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute the information on
            an
            unrestricted basis for any purpose whatsoever, unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by Phono.
            Further,
            Phono
            shall be free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained in such information for any
            purpose
            whatsoever, including but not limited to developing, manufacturing and marketing products incorporating such
            information.</p>
